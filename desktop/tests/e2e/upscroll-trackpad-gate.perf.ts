/**
 * TRACKPAD-MOMENTUM UPSCROLL GATE (W3/W4) — the merge-blocking, offline sibling
 * of T1.2's sync gate. T1.2 guards the writer's MATH (fixed synchronous step,
 * per-notch median-of-run); this gate guards the INPUT PATH Tyler actually
 * feels (a real wheel under momentum, whose per-notch Blink scaling of
 * 218/220/222 poisons median-of-run). The two JOIN — sync + felt — neither
 * replaces the other.
 *
 * WHY FELT, NOT SYNC-ONLY (Quinn's sharpening, Eva-ratified). The sync path
 * UNDER-REPORTS the WebKit defect ~4-5x (sync reds ~41px, felt reds ~200px):
 * the wheel path exercises realization-under-momentum that the settled sync
 * path never does. Sync catching *a* red is not sync catching the *whole* red —
 * a sync-only gate can false-green a "fix" that still lurches 200px on the
 * trackpad. Gate the path the user's input takes.
 *
 * THE METRIC — two legs, both on the reading row's per-frame `rect.top`, NEITHER
 * referencing scrollTop nor the dispatched wheel delta. Full derivation +
 * invariance proofs: RESEARCH/FELT_WHEEL_GATE_METRIC_W4.md (Quinn, W4).
 *
 *   p_i       = tracked row's viewport top, sampled PER FRAME i
 *   rowMove_i = p_i − p_{i-1}                                   (first diff)
 *
 * LEG 1 — peak lurch = peak |second difference| (jerk):
 *   lurch_i = |p_i − 2·p_{i-1} + p_{i-2}| = |rowMove_i − rowMove_{i-1}|
 *   gate    = max_i lurch_i ≤ MAX_PEAK_JERK_PX
 *
 * WHY JERK SURVIVES WHEEL-SCALING WITHOUT A MEDIAN OR INPUT CLOCK. Blink's
 * scaling makes rowMove a SMOOTH ramp (218,220,222…); the second difference of
 * any locally-linear sequence is ≈ 0 ((222−220)−(220−218)=0), so scaling
 * flattens itself with NO reference. It is the coordinate-free version of Eva's
 * "subtract the per-notch expected value" — differencing twice removes any
 * smooth trend without naming it, so no dispatched-delta reference (Quinn's
 * "Trap A" / timing-skew). Comp-invariant: a working writer produces smooth row
 * motion (holding at ~0 OR tracking smoothly, both second-diff 0); a failing
 * writer produces a one-frame realization spike → second-diff spikes.
 *
 * WHY PER-FRAME IS CORRECT HERE (and why it does NOT repeat the mistake that
 * killed my median-of-run). median-of-run needed per-NOTCH settled sampling: a
 * zero-motion per-RAF frame read as a false stall against the nonzero run
 * median. Jerk is IMMUNE to that exact ghost — a paused frame is rowMove_i=0 AND
 * rowMove_{i-1}=0 → second-diff 0. The sampling grain follows the metric: jerk
 * is a frame-to-frame second difference and REQUIRES per-frame p_i (Quinn, W4).
 *
 * LEG 2 — skip-forever = signed cumulative drift over a trailing horizon:
 *   drift_H = Σ_{i in H} max(0, −sign(scrollDir)·rowMove_i)     (anti-scroll)
 * Jerk MISSES a *sustained* reversal (constant reversal → second-diff 0 too).
 * Signed drift catches it: scaling changes forward MAGNITUDE, never SIGN, so
 * scaled notches contribute 0 to the anti-scroll accumulator while a sustained
 * reversal accumulates. sign(scrollDir) is the coarse run direction, a constant
 * — not a per-frame input delta, so Leg 2 also touches no input clock.
 *
 * EXCLUSION SET (doc §Contract summary). Prepend-commit frames (page legitly
 * gains height) and writer skip-catchup frames are EXCLUDED from Leg 1 peak — a
 * one-frame reanchor is a real single event, not a lurch. Because jerk is a
 * second difference, excluding a frame means BREAKING the diff sequence at it:
 * we reset the diff run and only score jerk within contiguous CLEAN spans (span
 * (a) in the thread — cleaner than dropping straddling windows, and a real lurch
 * that coincides with a commit is not lost, it re-appears on the next clean
 * span's first scored frame). Excluded frames are KEPT in Leg 2 drift.
 *
 * ENGINE FIDELITY — same mirror as T1.1/T1.2: shipped WKWebView has no
 * `overflow-anchor`, so we force `overflow-anchor: none` and Chromium reproduces
 * the shipped engine. Under `perf-webkit` this is the real WebKit family.
 *
 * ASYMMETRIC TWO-ENGINE CONTRACT (Eva-ratified; matches T1.2). The engines DO
 * NOT share the defect (Dawn's white-box RO logs: WebKit's correction never
 * fires, Chromium's fires and holds). So:
 *   - WebKit @ contract (`6b9203ca`): MUST be RED — the load-bearing validity
 *     proof. Dawn's fix turns it green.
 *   - Chromium: GREEN @ contract AND @ fix — a no-regression guard on the engine
 *     that already works. There is NO Chromium contract defect; a red there
 *     could only be a metric artifact. DO NOT "fix" Chromium's green red.
 * If a future change greens WebKit at contract WITHOUT the fix, this gate is
 * VOID — do not relax thresholds; restore the mirror/corpus so WebKit reds.
 *
 * GUARDRAIL / FALSIFIER (doc §Acceptance): a correct writer (Chromium
 * T1.2-green) MUST score ~0 on BOTH legs under wheel actuation. If Leg 1 can't
 * hold Chromium ~0 under scaling, the second-diff invariance claim is FALSE and
 * we fall back to sync-only (option 2). The ceilings below are pinned only after
 * the Chromium-green baseline number is on the record.
 *
 * Run (Chromium):
 *   pnpm build && npx playwright test --config=playwright.perf.config.ts \
 *     upscroll-trackpad-gate
 * Run (WebKit — the engine that reds at tip):
 *   npx playwright test --config=playwright.perf-webkit.config.ts \
 *     upscroll-trackpad-gate --project=perf-webkit

  // commit). This is "how far the row snapped backward from its furthest-forward
  // point before recovering," independent of how many frames the snap spans — a
  // 14.5px correction smeared across 6 low-velocity frames still reads as a
  // 14.5px drawdown, which Leg 1's per-frame 2nd diff misses.
  //
  // WHY DRAWDOWN, NOT A SUM-OF-ANTI-STEPS RUN. Summing every anti-scroll step
  // accumulates quantization noise across the long slow tail (a mostly-still row
  // micro-drifting ±0.5px never resets and sums to hundreds of px — a pure
  // artifact). Drawdown counts NET distance below the high-water mark, so
  // still-frame and sub-pixel jitter contribute ~0 and only a genuine sustained
  // backward snap registers. (WORK_LOG 2026-07-08: position-derivative scorers
