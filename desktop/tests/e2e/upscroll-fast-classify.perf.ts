/**
 * Fast-corpus reversal characterization — the SKIP admission gate.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The W4a gate (`upscroll-raf-correction.perf.ts`) drives a
 * CONSTANT 12px/32ms (~375px/s) upscroll and, on WebKit, leaves 3-4 bounded
 * reversal survivors (rows mock-jitter-387/393/381/375) that PASS the ≤4 gate.
 * The classifier that typed those survivors as SKIP (fired=false,
 * signedShift=0.0 → momentum-skip gate) was run against a fast-drive variant of
 * the slow-scroll leg that was NEVER committed — so the SKIP labels were not
 * reproducible from the tree. This fixture is that fast-drive classifier,
 * committed, so the admission evidence is permanent and re-runnable. It reuses
 * the slow leg's `probeLen` append-count join verbatim and adds two Leg-5
 * cross-checks (thread event 2a4e31fa, Eva's admission-gate ruling):
 *
 *   1. `dev = rowMove − scrollDelta` per reversal — Leg 5's rendered deviation
 *      from pure scroll-tracking. On a SKIP frame scrollDelta≈0 so dev≈rowMove
 *      with NO fired write behind it = abandonment, not a corrector footprint.
 *   2. A WIDEN-INDEPENDENT neighborhood dump. Dawn's class attribution picks the
 *      single largest-|signedShift| attempt in a ±1-frame append-count window;
 *      the ±1 widen is the soft joint Eva flagged. This fixture ALSO reports,
 *      for every reversal, whether ANY `wouldFire=true` record exists in a
 *      WIDER ±2-frame window — attribution-free. If no fired write sits near a
 *      survivor at any reasonable window width, SKIP is robust to the widen; if
 *      one does, the largest-|shift| rule would have labelled it grow/shrink and
 *      the SKIP bin is in question. That neighborhood flag is the admission gate.
 *
 * HONESTY BOUND (unchanged from the slow leg): Playwright `mouse.wheel` is a
 * synthetic discrete event; the WebKit `dScroll=0.0` coalesced still frame is a
 * real-device phenomenon. But the fast gate corpus DOES surface the bounded
 * survivors on Playwright WebKit, so this fixture reproduces the frames the
 * admission gate must rule on. It CHARACTERIZES; it does not gate a ceiling.
