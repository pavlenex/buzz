/**
 * Pure staleness + termination decision for scrolling a virtualized timeline to
 * a message that may be far off-screen.
 *
 * @tanstack/react-virtual already owns the OFFSET convergence: a single
 * `scrollToIndex(index)` captures that index in `scrollState`, and its internal
 * `reconcileScroll` rAF loop re-runs `getOffsetForIndex(index)` every frame —
 * re-aiming as off-screen rows mount and `measureElement` corrects their
 * heights — until the offset is stable (or a 5s safety valve fires). We do NOT
 * recompute offsets; duplicating `getOffsetForIndex` against the library's own
 * `measurementsCache`/`scrollMargin`/`scrollPadding` would only drift.
 *
 * What the library does NOT do: it chases the INDEX captured at call time, with
 * no concept of a message id. If the data shifts mid-settle — a prepend or a
 * delete above the target — the captured index now points at the wrong row and
 * the library happily settles on it. This reducer owns exactly that gap: each
 * frame it re-resolves the target's CURRENT index from the live map and decides
 * whether the adapter must re-aim the library, let it settle, or stop.
 *
 * Two correctness properties this enforces and the `.mjs` suite gates:
 *  - The target index is re-resolved by id every frame (never frozen), so a
 *    concurrent prepend/delete that shifts the target re-aims the library at the
 *    new index instead of stranding it on the old one.
 *  - If the target id leaves the data mid-settle (deleted), the loop terminates
 *    with `converged: false` rather than chasing a vanished row to the cap.
