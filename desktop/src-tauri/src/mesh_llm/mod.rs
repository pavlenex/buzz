//! Mesh-LLM client: discover, dial, and publish kind:31990 offers.
//!
//! This module is the desktop-side counterpart to `sprout-relay`'s embedded
//! iroh-relay (see `crates/sprout-relay/src/iroh_relay.rs`). The relay gates
//! admission with NIP-98 + relay membership; this module signs that bearer
//! token, dials offers advertised under kind:31990, and publishes our own
//! offer when the user enables compute-sharing.
//!
//! ## Submodules
//!
//! - [`endpoint`]: long-lived iroh endpoint keypair persisted at
//!   `{app_data_dir}/mesh_iroh.key`.
//! - [`nip98`]: build the NIP-98 bearer event signed with the user's Nostr
//!   key for a given canonical relay URL.
//! - [`offer`]: load/save the user's mesh-LLM offer preferences
//!   (VRAM/RAM/concurrency caps, models).

// Wildcard re-exports are deliberately avoided so that adding an

// wired yet) doesn't trip dead-code lints at the top level. Callers reach
// into the submodules directly until a public API surface stabilises.
