//! NIP-98 replay protection — shared, community-scoped, atomic seen-set.
//!
//! NIP-98 verification ([`crate::nip98::verify_nip98_event`]) is structurally
//! complete: it checks signature, kind, timestamp window, URL, method, and
//! optional body hash. It does **not** check whether the same event id has
//! already been used — that requires shared state. With multiple relay pods
//! ("any pod, any connection" per the rewrite §4 architecture), an in-process
//! cache (moka, DashMap) does not carry the freshness proof across pods, so
//! replay protection is a §5 hard gate.
//!
//! The required shape (§5):
//!
//! - shared state (Redis), atomic set-if-absent, TTL ≥ 120s
//! - community-scoped key — see [`nip98_replay_key`]
//!
//! ## Usage shape
//!
//! Verify first, then mark. Burning a seen-set slot on a forgery would let an
//! attacker who knows a future event id of a victim DoS the legitimate event.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let pubkey = buzz_auth::verify_nip98_event(json, url, method, body)?;
//! if !replay.try_mark(&ctx, &event_id).await? {
//!     return Err(AuthError::Nip98Replay);
//! }
//! // safe to honor the request as `pubkey`
//! ```
//!
//! The TTL must cover the verifier's clock-skew tolerance (currently ±60s, so
//! the window over which a duplicate event id is even plausible is 2×60 = 120s).
//! [`DEFAULT_REPLAY_TTL_SECS`] is the floor; deployments may raise it.
